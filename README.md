# Signal clone with REACT Native
  A copy of the Signal app to learn and improve coding skills with the React Native framework.
  (Navigation, Expo & Firebase)
  

## What I have learned in this project are:

  1. Context api to provide a way to share values (global variables) like user info after authentication between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.
  2. Custom Hook: When we have component logic that needs to be used by multiple components, we can extract that logic to a custom Hook
